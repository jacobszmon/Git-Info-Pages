When working on a project it is best to have a history of that project you can always revert to. In Software Development and other fields of development we use Version Control. This allows us to track our changes through applications like Git. Version Control helps track bugs and allow collaborations with others on the same project over multiple devices, along with many other features. 

## The Role of Version Control in Software Development    

**Version Control**, also known as **revision control** or **source control**, is the management of changes to documents like computer programs. CTRL-Z is the simplest form of version control!

**Some documents have more advanced version control built-in** 
- Microsoft Word has a "Track Changes" feature.
- Google Docs automatically tracks file changes over.
- You can see the edit history of all Wikipedia articles. [(Here's the history of the version control article.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Version_control&action=history)


## What is Git?
### Version Control with Git 
- Git is a free and open source distributed version control system.
- Git helps us keep track of the changes to our source code over the lifespan of a project.
- When combined with cloud version control sites like GitHub or GitLab, we can use git to collaborate with others remotely.


### Why Git?
- With Git, you can make a "commit" (which is like a save point of your repo) as often as you'd like. 
- You can also go back to previous commits. This takes the pressure off of you while you're working. 
- When you commit often and commit early you'll never have that sinking feeling of overwriting or losing changes. 
- Git allows us to work offline if necessary and synchronize with a distributed team.

### Why Not Git?
- Not especially user friendly for non-developers.
- No built-in support for large repos, although the [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) add-on exists.
- No built-in support for locking binary assets. (Locking can be enabled with Git LFS.)

### Git Resources 
- [Git Guide](https://github.com/git-guides) - Official git Learning Guides from the folks at GitHub.
- [Git Cheat Sheet](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/)- The most popular git commands in one page.
- [Pro Git Book](http://git-scm.com/book) - Free ebook provides a deep dive into everything git


## Wiki Authors

**Sadie**:

Hello, my name is Sadie. I am a programmer at RRC Polytechnic's Game Development program. Some of my hobbies include reading, crocheting and playing puzzle games. I enjoy a good cup of coffee, tea or any chocolate beverage or snack. Some of my favorite foods are bread, chocolate, watermelon or meat. I also like my fair share of salmon, my dad makes the best salmon I have ever tasted.


**Samuel**:

Hey there, I am Samuel Daya, a programmer at RRC Polytechnic's Game Development Program. I enjoy playing Trading Card Games, bullet hell games, and collecting CDs. My favourite fruit is a classic apple but if you pass me a lemon I will take a big bite. The best meal that I have consumed until now and maybe for the rest of my life is a Norwegian waffle with smoked salmon called a Rokelaks Waffle from KOS Waffles.


**Jake:**

Hi! I'm Jake, and I'm programmer and writer currently enrolled in RRC Polytechnic's Game Development program. I'm a massive fan of all sorts of video games, with a special focus on RPGs with well written characters. I play a lot of DnD, probably too much, and I like to read when I can find the time. My favorite food is my Baba's perogies, but lately a good shawarma has been my kryptonite.
