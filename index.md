When working on a project it is best to have a history of that project you can always revert to. In Software Development and other fields of development we use Version control. This allows us to track our changes through applications like Git. Git helps track bugs and allow collaborations with others on the same project over multiple devices, along with many other features.

# The Role of Version Control in Software Development    

**Version Control** also known as **revision control** or **source control**, is the management of changes to documents like computer programs. CTRL-Z is the simplest form of version control!

**Some documents have more advanced version control built-in** 
- Microsoft Word has a "Track Changes" feature.
- Google Docs automatically tracks file changes over.
- You can see the edit history of all Wikipedia articles. [(Here's the history of the version control article.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Version_control&action=history)


# What is Git?
## Version Control with Git 
- Git is a free and open source distributed version control system.
- Git helps us keep track of the changes to our source code over the lifespan of a project.
- When combined with cloud version control sites like GitHub or GitLab, we can use git to collaborate with others remotely.


## Why Git?
- With Git, you can make a "commit", or a save of your repo, as often as you'd like. 
- You can also go back to previous commits. This takes the pressure off of you while you're working. 
- When you commit often and commit early you'll never have that gut sinking feeling of overwriting or losing changes. 
- Git Allows us to work offline if necessary and synchronize with a distributed team.

## Why Not Git?
- Not especially user friendly for non-developers.
- No built-in support for large repos, although the [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) add-on exists.
- No built-in support for locking binary assets. (Locking can be enabled with Git LFS.)

Hi! I'm Jake, and I'm programmer and writer currently enrolled in RRC Polytechnic's Game Development program. I'm a massive fan of all sorts of video games, with a special focus on RPGs with well written characters. I play a lot of DnD, probably too much, and I read when I can find the time. My favorite food is my Baba's perogies, but lately a good shawarma has been my kryptonite.
