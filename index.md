When working on a project it is best to have a history of that project you can always revert to. In Software Development and other fields of development we use Version control. This allows us to track our changes through applications like Git. Git helps track bugs and allow collaborations with others on the same project over multiple devices, along with many other features.

# The Role of Version Control in Software Development    

**Version Control** also known as **revision control** or **source control**, is the management of changes to documents like computer programs. CTRL-Z is the simplest form of version control

##### Some documents have more advanced version control built-in
- Microsoft Word has a "Track Changes" feature.
- Google Docs automatically tracks file changes over.
- You can see the edit history of all Wikipedia articles.
