# Git Fundamentals 
{: .no_toc }

Git Fundamentals is the baseline of using Git. Here we will learn how to create repos, stage and commit files and many more things!. Git allows us to use CTRL-Z to a whole new level within a project. With Git we have the power to revert our whole project to the state it was a week ago.

CTRL-Z lets us undo changes in files we have open,
but it has limitations:
- What if you wanted to undo a change to a file you made weeks ago?
- What if you wanted to undo a change made to a file by someone else?
- What if you wanted to experiment with a series of changes and then revert back to a specific version of the file?
