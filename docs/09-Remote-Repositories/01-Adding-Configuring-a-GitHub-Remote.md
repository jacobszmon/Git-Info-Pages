# Adding / Configuring a GitHub Remote 
{: .no_toc }

GitHub is one of many Git version control remote repository services that you can use.

Using GitHub will give you access to remote repositories and allow for you to make changes to your repository from any machine as long as it is all linked to the same repository.

This is also a build up to using GitHub for turning your repository to a collaborative team project.
