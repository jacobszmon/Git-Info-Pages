# Initializing Repositories 
{: .no_toc }

Creating repositories are the first and most important step when creating a new project. This is our main project in where we will store and edit files and the place where we will commit them.

To bring a new project **under control** we must first initialize the repository (the repo)
from within the project's root folder:
To initialize a new git repo from the command prompt: 
```
git init .
```

Note: Git defaults to using the word "master" ([as in "master copy" or "master recording"](https://git.github.io/rev_news/2020/07/29/edition-65/)) for
the main branch, but we can change this:
```
git branch -m main
```
