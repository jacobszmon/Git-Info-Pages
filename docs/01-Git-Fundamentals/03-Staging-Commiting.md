# Staging and committing
{: .no_toc }

Before we commit our files to our repo, we must first stage them. This is were we give clear and concise commit messages. Commit messages benefit everyone, they allow group members and yourself to look at what changes you have made. This allows groups to track and manage commits. 

## Table of Contents
{: .no_toc }

## Staging Files Before we Commit
As we make changes to our code we **commit** the changes to our git repo.
Before we can **commit** we must **add** new or changed files to a staging area.

**Let's stage our new readme.md file:**
``git add readme.md``
We could also use a period to stage all new or modified files:
``git add .``

Wilcards and sub-folders work too:
``git add docs/textfiles/*.txt``

## Committing Staged Files
We **commit** our staged changes with a commit message.
For complex changes, we can include a short title, followed by a long explaination:

``` 
git commit -m "Your explanation of the changes goes here."
git commit -m "Title" -m "Long description goes here .........."; 
```

We can even [configure git to open a text editor of our choice using:](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/associating-text-editors-with-git)
``git commit``

## Good Commit Messages are Crucial!
Quality commit messages contribution to:
- **Traceability**: Commit messages clarify code history and aid in debugging.
- **Collaboration**: They help others understand the intentions behind changes.
- **Documentation**: They act as a form of source code documentation.
- **Change Management:** - "Change Logs" based on commits are often shipped with
each release.

#### Bad Commit Messages:
- fixing stuff
- Final version.
- asdf

#### Good Commit Messages:
- Enhance user experience by validating sign up form fields.
- Improve code readability by refactoring PlayerRegistrationService.
- Prevent null reference crashes by adding pointer checks in the teleport code.
