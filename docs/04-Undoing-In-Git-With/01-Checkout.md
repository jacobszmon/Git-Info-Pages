# Checkout
{: .no_toc }

Checkout is a git command that provides a simple, yet slightly dangerous way to undo uncommitted work in a git repository.

## Table of Contents
{: .no_toc }

## What is Checkout?
Checkout is the simplest way to privately undo work in a git repository. It allows you to discard any **unstaged** and **uncommitted** changes to **tracked** files in a local git repository.

_⚠️ **WARNING**: Using ```git checkout``` can be slightly dangerous. The discarded changes cannot be recovered._


## How to use Checkout
If you want to revert changes to a single unstaged file to the most recent commit:
```
git checkout <path-or-filename>
```


If you want to revert changes to all unstaged files and folders to the most recent commit:
```
git checkout .
```
