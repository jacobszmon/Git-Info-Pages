# The How and Why of Team Git Workflow

Working with a team is a vital component of larger projects, but having too many cooks in the kitchen can lead to many issues.

Git and Github allow for multiple developers to work on the same project without stepping on each other's shoes.

## Overview of Git Workflows

Git workflows are methods or procedures that dictate how developers interact with the Git system to achieve effective team collaboration.

There are several popular workflows used by teams:

**Centralized Workflow**
- Perfect for small teams.
- Each new feature updates the repository and keeps collaboration close.

**Feature Branch Workflow**
- Perfect for multiple feature developments
- Main branch is kept clean and experimental branches are pulled when ready.

**Forking Workflow**
- Perfect for open-source projects
- Original repository is kept clean and a project maintainer controls which pull request can be merged.

## Collaborative Coding with Git and GitHub

Key concepts include:

- Forking: Creating a personal remote copy of another user's remote repository.
- Cloning: Making a full copy of a repository at its current state.
- Committing: Saving changes to the local repository.
- Pushing: Sending committed changes to a remote repository.
- Pull Requests: Proposing changes to a repository that can be reviewed and potentially merged.
